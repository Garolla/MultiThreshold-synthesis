# MultiThreshold-synthesis
Assignment of the "Synthesis and optimization of digital systems" course at Politecnico di Torino, academic year 2015/2016. 

The contest was about writing a TCL scirpt to be used within Design Compiler that performs a Slack-driven Dual-Vth postsynthesis
optimization. 
The goal was to reduces leakage power by means of dual-Vth assignment while forcing the number of quasi-critical paths below a user-defined constraint.
